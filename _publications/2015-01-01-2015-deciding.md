excerpt: 'Now used for high-performance computing applications, the cloud presents a challenge for users who must decide, based on efficiency and cost-effectiveness, when and how to run jobs on cloud-based resources versus when to use on-premise clusters. The authors propose a decision-support system to help make these determinations.'

Now used for high-performance computing applications, the cloud presents a challenge for users who must decide, based on efficiency and cost-effectiveness, when and how to run jobs on cloud-based resources versus when to use on-premise clusters. The authors propose a decision-support system to help make these determinations.
