excerpt: 'Object detection models rely on deep networks that offer model builders limited agency over model construction, refinement and maintenance. We propose and assess an expressive teaching language for specifying object detectors which includes constructs such as concepts and relationships. We identified language building blocks and articulated design goals for creating interactive experiences in teaching object detection.'
