excerpt: ' This work contributes a more holistic understanding of how researchers conduct literature reviews. We followed a user-centered approach encompassing (a) a formative study on literature review practices of 15 researchers which informed (b) the design of LitSense, a proof-of-concept tool to support literature review workflows, and (c) a week-long study with 12 researchers performing a literature review with Litsense.'
