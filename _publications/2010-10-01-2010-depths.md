excerpt: 'Modern reservoir engineering is dependent on 3D visualization tools. However, tools used in this domain are not fully aligned with the reservoir engineer&apos;s interactive needs, and do not address fundamental user issues, such as collaboration. We base our work on a set of observations of reservoir engineers, and their unique interactive tasks and needs. We present insightful knowledge of the domain, and follow with a prototype for an interactive reservoir visualization system, on the Microsoft Surface.'
